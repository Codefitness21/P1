                <p>Below are some of my favorite designs created in Photoshop, ranging from small to large builds. These designs are tailored for apps used in sporting and music events. While browsing websites, I gathered ideas specific to each organization's branding to create modular designs for these apps. Hover over the image on desktop and press and hold the image on tablet and mobile devices to read about my process for creating each one.</p>

            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/crypto-cardsm-stadium.png" class="avatar" alt="Crypto Stadium">
                <div class="layer">
                    <div class="small-card-text"> I used two separate backgrounds for this design: an image of the Crypto Arena and another displaying their color and hexagon logo. I added a layer mask to both image layers and used the Gradient tool to blend the two images, with the blue hexagon image blending more into the arena image. I then pasted in the Crypto.com logo as a separate layer and used the Horizontal Type tool to write out the "Stadium Information". </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/NCAA-cardsm-liveresults.png" alt="NCAA Live Results"><div class="layer">
                <div class="small-card-text">The trophy picture served as the primary background image. Using the Polygonal Lasso tool, I created a diagonal cut through the image, which I then filled with a blue background. To enhance the separation, I used the Pen tool to create a 5px diagonal white line. I placed a blue overlay over the track and field image, reducing the opacity of both images to 95% to achieve a subtle blend, allowing the track image to softly show through the blue overlay. I then added the NCAA championship logo as a separate layer and used the Horizontal Type tool to write "LIVE RESULTS."</div>
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/NCAA-cardsm-eventschedule.png" alt="NCAA Event Schedule"><div class="layer">
                <div class="small-card-text">The celebratory picture displaying a hoisted trophy served as the primary background image. Using the Polygonal Lasso tool, I created a diagonal cut through the image, which I then filled with a blue background on the left side of the image to show some variety from the live results image. To enhance the separation, I used the Pen tool to create a 5px diagonal white line. I placed a blue overlay over the track and field image, reducing the opacity of both images to 95% to achieve a subtle blend, allowing the track image to softly show through the blue overlay. I then added the NCAA championship logo as a separate layer and used the Horizontal Type tool to write "EVENT SCHEDULE."</div>
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/Olympic-cardsm-liveresults.png" alt="Olympic Trials Live Results"><div class="layer">
                <div class="small-card-text">The red Olympic Trials design banner served as the primary background image. I applied a layer mask to the image and used the Polygonal Lasso tool to create top and bottom diagonal cuts, giving it an arrow-shape appearance that points towards the title, "LIVE RESULTS."   To enhance the separation, I used the Pen tool to create a 2px diagonal white line. I then used the Horizontal Type tool to write "LIVE RESULTS."</div>
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/Olympic-cardsm-medal.png" alt="Medal"><div class="layer">
                <div class="small-card-text">The blue Olympic Trials design banner served as the primary background image. I applied a layer mask to the image and used the Polygonal Lasso tool to create top and bottom diagonal cuts, giving it an arrow-like appearance that points towards the title, "LIVE RESULTS."  The image of the medal initially didn't fit within the arrow shaped space due to its narrow dark background. To fix this, I used the Rectangular Marquee tool and the content-aware fill option to stretch the dark background, ensuring it met the parameters of the image cut. To enhance the separation, I used the Pen tool to create a 2px diagonal white line. I then used the Horizontal Type tool to write "MEDAL CEREMONY SCHEDULE."</div>
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/BRU-cardsm-bgs.png" alt="Boston Garden Society"><div class="layer">
                <div class="small-card-text">The primary image used is of TD Gardens Arena, overlaid on a black background that features the Boston Garden Society logo. The arena image was aligned to the left to reveal the underlying black color. Text was added as a layer and positioned between 5px lines drawn with the Pen tool.</div>
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/BRU-cardsm-donations.png" alt="Bruins Donations"><div class="layer">
                <div class="small-card-text">The design features the Bruins' signature wallpaper from their website, combined with another image that is black with white speckles, creating a dust-like effect. This speckled image was overlaid on the patterned background with a reduced opacity of 79%. A layer mask was applied to both images, and the Gradient tool was used to blend them together, allowing the patterned background to peek out on both sides, adjacent to the yellow, black, and white borders. The foundation logo was added as a separate layer, and the text "DONATIONS" was included using the Horizontal Type tool. A solid black background was used as a base to ensure a dark theme throughout the design.</div>
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/TEN-cardmd-fansurvey.png" alt="Titans Fan Survey"><div class="layer">
                <div class="medium-card-text">The primary image of delighted fans was used as the background, layered over a white background. Next, one of the Titans' team color, light blue, was applied over the image. Using layer masks on both images, the Gradient tool was employed to gradually blend the blue color vertically, covering about a fourth of the way up the fans' image. This technique created a seamless blend of the two images. Under the Image tab, I selected Adjustments and used the Desaturate feature to achieve an overall blended blue look, representing one of their team colors. I then used the Horizontal Type tool to write "FAN SURVEY" and incorporated the red line from their website as a separate layer, aligning it underneath the text to match the Titans' color branding scheme.</div>
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/TEN-cardmd-shop.png" alt="Titans Shop"><div class="layer">
                <div class="medium-card-text">The design features a split background of light and dark blue as the base. To enhance the dark blue side, I added light blue brush stroke images for a more balanced appearance. Three different merch item images representing the Titans' team name and colors were cropped from the original photo and pasted individually as separate layers onto the background in a staggered appearance. I then used the Horizontal Type tool to write "SHOP" and incorporated the red line from their website as a separate layer, aligning it underneath the text to match the Titans' branding theme.</div>
            </div></div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/TEN-cardmd-pog.png" alt="Titans Player of Game"><div class="layer">
                <div class="medium-card-text">The design features a split background of light and dark blue as the base. To enhance the light blue side, I added dark blue brush stroke images for a more balanced appearance. The image of the player was cropped from the original photo and pasted as a separate layer onto the background. Red drawings, matching the Titans' branding theme, were incorporated around the player, echoing the style used throughout their website. I then used the Horizontal Type tool to write "PLAYER OF THE GAME" and incorporated the red line from their website as a separate layer, aligning it underneath the text to match the Titans' branding theme.</div>
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/NY-cardmd-Mastercard.png" alt="Yankees Mastercard"><div class="layer">
                <div class="medium-card-text">For this straightforward design, I used the Yankees' pinstripe background as the base and added the MasterCard image as a separate layer. I then used the Horizontal Type tool to write "You Could Earn Two Free Tickets." </div>
            </div></div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/NY-cardmd-Mobileapp.png" alt="Yankees Mobile app"><div class="layer">
                <div class="medium-card-text"> The MLB App logo was added as a layer to the background. To refine the image, I removed the other baseball players, keeping only Aaron Judge displayed. I used the Generative Fill tool to remove the players and then used the Clone Stamp tool and Polygon Lasso tool to clean up areas where Generative Fill didn't work perfectly.</div>
            </div></div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/NY-cardmd-Raffle.png" alt="Yankees Raffle"><div class="layer">
                <div class="medium-card-text">For this design, I used the Yankees' pinstripe background along with the 50/50 Raffle Logo as the centerpiece. I then utilized a layer grouping technique to align the background pinstripes with the lines within the logo.</div>
            </div></div> 
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/crypto-cardmd-app.png" alt="Crypto App"><div class="layer">
                <div class="medium-card-text">For the base, I used the Crypto hexagon background with the Pin Light setting under the layers tab and lowered the opacity to 90% to lighten it and give it a subtle glow. I added a classic light blue gradient background behind the hexagon background to enhance the illumination. The Crypto.com logo and a mobile phone image were pasted in as separate layers, with the mobile phone giving a drop shadow effect to create separation from the background. </div>
            </div></div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/crypto-cardmd-concessions.png" alt="Crypto Concessions"><div class="layer">
                <div class="medium-card-text">I used the food image as the primary background, occupying most of the space. For the header, I added a blue hexagon background with "ORDER AHEAD CONCESSIONS" written using the Horizontal Type tool. To create separation between the two images, I used the Pen tool to draw a horizontal dividing line, scaling it to about 2px.</div>
            </div></div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/crypto-cardmd-Lexus.png" alt="Lexus"><div class="layer">
                <div class="medium-card-text">The Crypto hexagon background was used as the base. To match the Premium Lexus color theme, I applied the Luminosity feature from the layers tab to change the color to black. The Crypto.com Arena Premium and Lexus Club logos were added as separate layers, ensuring the correct font was used. I then added the Lexus logo as another layer and used the Horizontal Type tool to write "Enter To Win". Everything was aligned to be centered.</div>
            </div></div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/crypto-cardmd-LA_Live.png" alt="La Live"><div class="layer">
                <div class="medium-card-text"> I started with the LA LIVE background image as the base. Next, I created a purple color layer and added a layer mask. Using the Gradient tool, I blended the purple color at the bottom, gradually, vertically extending it to cover about a quarter of the image. On top of this, I pasted the LA LIVE logo as a separate layer. </div>
            </div></div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/crypto-cardmd-YAAMAVA.png" alt="Yaamava"><div class="layer">
                <div class="medium-card-text">I used an image from the Yaamava website as the background, carefully aligning it to showcase the hotel, pool, cabanas, and palm trees. I then added the Yaamava Resort logo and text from their website as a layer. Using the Horizontal Type tool, I wrote "Club Serrano" and "Enter To Win." Next, I used the Pen tool to draw vertical and horizontal dividing lines, scaling them to about 2px. To ensure evenness, I utilized the guidelines available in the View tab.</div>
            </div></div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/Celt-cardmd-draftkings.png" alt="Draftkings"><div class="layer">
                <div class="medium-card-text">The primary background features the black, orange, and green color scheme from their website. I applied a layer mask to the image and added a black background beneath it, also with a layer mask. To address the white space on the left side of the image after a necessary right alignment, I filled it with black using the Gradient tool. Finally, I centered the DraftKings logo as a separate layer.</div>
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/Celt-cardmd-merch.png" alt="Celtics Merch"><div class="layer">
                <div class="medium-card-text">I began with a Celtics green patterned background as the base. To emphasize their remarkable season and fill in the space, I added images of their championship merchandise alongside the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy. To make the trophy stand out and create a sense of depth, I applied an outer glow effect. Finally, I used the Horizontal Type tool to write "CHAMPIONSHIP MERCHANDISE," adding a bold statement to the design.</div>
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/Celt-cardmd-tdgarden.png" alt="TD Garden"><div class="layer">
                <div class="medium-card-text">The primary background features an image of TD Gardens arena filled with spectators. I added a mobile phone spread layout as a separate layer. To seamlessly integrate the crowd into a solid black background for the mobile phones, I applied a layer mask to the background image and used the Gradient tool for a smooth blend. The TD Garden logo was then pasted in, and I used the Horizontal Type tool to write "MOBILE ORDERING," clearly conveying the design's purpose. One of the tweaks made for further perfection involved using the Rectangular Marquee tool to clone the right side of the phone's border and paste it on the left side, effectively covering up some unfavorable markings.</div>
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/BRU-cardmd-dunkin.png" alt="Dunkin Donuts"><div class="layer">
                <div class="medium-card-text">To enhance Dunkin Donuts' color theme, an off-white background was chosen. Various food and beverage products were meticulously placed to create a visually appealing and marketable arrangement. The Dunkin logo was added as a distinct layer, and the Horizontal Type tool was used to write "PLINKO GAME."</div>
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/BRU-cardmd-fanduel.png" alt="Fanduel"><div class="layer">
                <div class="medium-card-text"> I used the background image from their website with the existing sports thumbnails at a reduced opacity. I added the horseracing and football fantasy images, also reducing their opacity to 25% to blend seamlessly with the existing background elements. This approach effectively showcases the various features available on FanDuel. I then added the mobile devices with an outer glow effect and included their logo to complete the design</div>
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/Celts-cardlg-5050.png" alt="Celtics 5050 Raffle"><div class="layer">
                <div class="large-card-text"> I created a clean and simple design featuring the Celtics' iconic patterned background. I added the clover and the 50/50 Raffle logo, then used the Horizontal Type tool to write "BOSTON CELTICS SHAMROCK FOUNDATION".</div>
            </div>
        </div> 
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/BRU-cardlg-5050.png" alt="Bruins 5050 Raffle"><div class="layer">
                <div class="large-card-text">The Bruins' signature patterned background serves as the base, with a yellow textured border at the top and bottom and a leather-like texture on the right and left sides, directing attention to the central information. The Foundations and 50/50 raffle logos are added as separate layers. Above these logos, the words “ENTER THE” are typed using the Horizontal Type tool, introducing the pasted information.</div>
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="grid-item"><img src="img2/TEN-welcomepage.png" alt="Titans Welcome Page"><div class="layer">
                <div class="large-card-text">The background was crafted by incorporating some of the Titans' iconic patterned designs, arranging them to create a grunge effect with a dominant dark blue hue. This design features white textured patterns, horizontal streaks, and irregular elements for added visual appeal. The Gradient tool was used to blend the asymmetrical background patches. The autographed football was added as a separate layer, enhanced with a custom square glass effect, and colored blue to match the Titans' team color with added stroke, gradient overlay, and drop shadow effects. The Titans Marketplace logo was also added as a distinct layer. Using the Horizontal Type tool, I wrote "Win Autographed Memorabilia!" and included the red line from their website, positioning it beneath the text to maintain the Titans' branding style.</div>
